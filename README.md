# Dreamsequence

Requirements: Monome Norns and Grid
Optional: Crow, Just Friends, MIDI sequencer/controller, CV sources

Dreamsequence is a chord-centric composer, arpeggiator, CV/MIDI harmonizer, and arranger. It takes a walled-garden approach to composition that prioritizes efficiency and experimentation.

Dreamsequence's chord sequencer lays the foundation of the composition, which can then be embellished with the arpeggiator and by transforming external CV or MIDI sequences with the harmonizer.

Although the efficient workflow is ideal for creating musical sketches, it is also possible to use the Arranger to create a song with various sections, dynamic changes, and procedural transformations.
