# Dreamsequence

Requirements: Monome Norns and Grid
Optional: Crow, Just Friends, MIDI sequencer/controller, CV sources

Dreamsequence is a chord-centric composer, arpeggiator, CV/MIDI harmonizer, and arranger. It was designed as a sort of compositional walled-garden for folks who may not have a strong music theory background (or just don't enjoy working with traditional tools like the piano-roll). It has a very quick workflow that is ideal for creating musical sketches, but with some work in the Arranger it's possible to create a song with various sections, dynamic changes, and even procedural transformations.
